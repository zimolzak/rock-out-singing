\section*{Be Prepared}

\begin{verse}

\small

Be \ch{prepared}{C}! That's the Boy Scout's marching song\\
Be \ch{prepared}{G}! As through life you march along\\
Be \ch{prepared}{C} to hold your \ch{liquor}{E} pretty \ch{well}{A}\\
Don't write \ch{naughty}{D} words on walls if you can't \ch{spell}{G}\\

Be \ch{prepared}{C}! To hide that pack of cigarettes\\
Don't make \ch{book}{G} if you cannot cover bets\\
Keep those \ch{reefers}{C} hidden \ch{where}{C7} you're sure that \ch{they}{F} will not be found\\
And be \ch{careful}{D} not to smoke them when the \ch{scoutmaster's}{G} around\\
For he \ch{only}{C} will \ch{insist}{F} that it be \ch{shared}{D}, \ch{~}{G} be \ch{prepared}{C}!\\

~\\

Be prepared! That's the Boy Scouts' solemn creed\
Be prepared! And be clean in word and deed\\
Don't solicit for your sister, that's not nice\\
Unless you get a good percentage of her price\\

Be prepared! And be careful not to do\\
Your good deeds when there's no one watching you\\
If you're looking for adventure of a new and different kind\\
And you come across a Girl Scout who is similarly inclined\\
Don't be nervous, don't be flustered, don't be scared, be prepared!\\

\end{verse}

\section*{Blow Ye Winds}

\begin{verse}

\small

'Twas \ch{advertised}{G} in Boston, New York, and Buffalo\\
A \ch{hundred}{C} brave \ch{Americans}{G} a \ch{whaling}{D} for to go\\

~\\

Singing \ch{Blow}{G} ye winds in the morning and blow ye winds hi ho\\
\ch{Clear}{C} away your \ch{running}{G} gear and \ch{blow}{D} boys \ch{blow}{G}\\

~\\

They'll \ch{take}{G} you to New Bedford that famous whaling port\\
And \ch{Hand}{C} you to some \ch{landsharks}{G} to \ch{board}{D} and fit you out\\

~\\

Singing \ch{Blow}{G} ye winds in the morning and blow ye winds hi ho\\
\ch{Clear}{C} away your \ch{running}{G} gear and \ch{blow}{D} boys \ch{blow}{G}\\

\end{verse}
