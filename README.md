Rock Out Singing
========

Make a fake book with plain LaTeX. The idea is to make it two column,
with big sans-serif chord symbols, kind of like _Rise Up Singing._ But
I want the chord symbols above the words, not between verses. There is
also an attempt to do this using Lilypond, which didn't work as well.
